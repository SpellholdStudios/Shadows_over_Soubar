@5090 = ~Selence Hillstar:  Owed Money

It seems that my newest contact, a thief in Athkatla, knows something about who has been looking for me.  She has struck a deal with these people but won't tell me who just yet, and thinks she needs to test me first.  I'm not sure what its all about yet, but she says some Amnish noble owes her money.  I'm to retrieve the gold from his safe at this noble's home in the government district of Athkatla.~

//CBPROM06.BAF
@5091 = ~No More Shadows Over Soubar

After defeating Rolf Sureblade and his bandits in Lyrar's Hold, I returned triumphantly to Soubar.  It was a warm reception, and I was offered the honorable position as Mayor of Soubar.  I couldn't accept it, however, and must continue on with my career as an adventurer.  The folk here are too busy rebuilding their homes, farms, or other property destroyed in the raids, and deserve a leader that they can count on.~
@5092 = ~Chief Lieutenant Promotion

The mayor of Soubar has rewarded me with the promotion to Chief Lieutenant.  Imagine, me, a simple <PRO_GIRLBOY> from Candlekeep becoming the <PRO_SONDAUGHTER> of a dead god and even rising high in the ranks of a Chief Lieutenant!~
@5093 = ~Chief Lieutenant Promotion

Gaius, the Paladin of Soubar has rewarded me with the promotion to Chief Lieutenant, in the absence of an elected official.  Imagine, me, a simple <PRO_GIRLBOY> from Candlekeep becoming the <PRO_SONDAUGHTER> of a dead god and even rising high in the ranks of a Chief Lieutenant!~
@5094 = ~Assault on Lyrar's Hold

After the assault the bandits perpetrated against Soubar, I have been authorized to use whatever force is necessary to defeat the bandits, including my own attack on their stronghold.  I've discussed the options of such an attack with the Major, but many of his men were wounded or killed in the bandit raid and he cannot afford to send men to assist me.  I will have to do it alone.  He has shown me two ways into the Keep:  an overland route which would force me to seige the castle's bailey walls, or a network of tunnels running below ground from Soubar to the Hold.  I do not know which way I will take, but both will be dangerous in their own ways.  Major has wished me good luck in my mission, and I hope to return to Soubar soon.~

//CBPROM05.BAF
@5095 = ~No More Shadows Over Soubar

After defeating Rolf Sureblade and his bandits in Lyrar's Hold, I returned triumphantly to Soubar.  It was a warm reception, and I have taken over the honorable position as Mayor of Soubar.  I don't expect that there will be much to do, as many of the folk are too busy rebuilding thier homes, farms, or other property destroyed in the raids.  For now, I think I will settle down for a while.~

@50100 = ~Spy in Soubar!

Unconfirmed reports from the Mayor's office and the Major show that the bandits may be getting some information about Soubar, it's resources, defenses, and the like from an inside man.  I do not know who this could be, but I will root out the spy, if one does exist.  He will pay for his treachery.~
@50101 = ~Possible Spy Suspects

I've spoken with my old friend Winthrop about some of the happenings in Soubar which could hint at the fact that there is, or could be, a spy in Soubar.  A ranger who was visiting Winthrop's inn at the time overheard our conversation, and helped me to work out who could possibly be the spy.   We made a list of these suspects, and I will investigate each of them.
*Ranger in Winthrop's Inn
*Winthrop himself
*The Mayor of Soubar, Sirrus Melandor
*Someone who bought A. Miller's house
*Someone, or someones, in the Soubar Social Club
*The boy I rescued from the farm, Charlie
*Displaced farmers fighting in an old warehouse.~
@50120 = ~Spy in Soubar?

I believe that I may have solved the mystery of a spy in Soubar.  I think that it is Winthrop, the man I thought was my freind, but he pleads innocence.  I have jailed him below the Guard Barracks where he will have to await trial.~
@50121 = ~Spy In Soubar:

It seems that the Major's suspicions have proved true.  There was a spy in Soubar, and it turned out to be, of all people, my old friend Winthrop.  Rolf Sureblade rescued him and I was ambushed during the melee.~

//CB285FTX.D
@50122 = ~Spy In Soubar:

It seems that the Major's suspicions have proved true.  There was a spy in Soubar, and it turned out to be the fighters who used to be farmers in outlying farms near Soubar.  Rolf Sureblade rescued them and I was ambushed during the melee.~
@50123 = ~Spy in Soubar?

I believe that I may have solved the mystery of a spy in Soubar.  I think that it is the fighters who were displaced from their farms near Soubar, but they plead innocence.  I have jailed them below the Guard Barracks where they will have to await trial.~

//CB428MJ.D
@50103 = ~Promotion

Major has promoted me to the rank of Staff Sergeant for the work I've done in the Soubar Militia.  I expect that with this rank comes greater responsibility, but also greater rewards.~
@50105 = ~Soubar Militia Promotion!

Once again, the Major was quite pleased with my completion of the missions he ordered me to perform.  He has awarded me a promotion, that to rank of Captain.  I am pleased with this, because it means that I will no longer need to use Soubar issued equipment and can use my own weapons and armor.~

//CBCHRRAN.D
@50124 = ~Spy in Soubar?

I believe that I may have solved the mystery of a spy in Soubar.  I think that it is the Ranger who was staying at Winthrop's inn, but he pleads innocence.  I have jailed him below the Guard Barracks where he will have to await trial.~

//CBISSON2.D
@50125 = ~Spy In Soubar:

It seems that the Major's suspicions have proved true.  There was a spy in Soubar, and it turned out to be the man who I had originally met back in Trademeet, Ceeb Isson.  Rolf Sureblade rescued the man and I was ambushed during the melee.~

//CBSIRRUS.D
@50126 = ~Soubar Attacked!

Soubar was attacked by a small contingent of bandits earlier, and the death toll could not even be calculated.  I do not know how many Soubarians or guardsmen lost their lives to the bandits, but I am becoming increasingly upset that Major will not allow me to attack the keep known as Lyrar's Hold.  Something must be done for the town, and I feel that I am wasting my time by defending it.~
@50127 = ~Spy In Soubar:

It seems that the Major's suspicions have proved true.  There was a spy in Soubar, and it turned out to be, of all people, the Mayor of Soubar himself, Sirrus Melandor.  Rolf Sureblade rescued the Mayor and I was ambushed during the melee.~
@50106 = ~Arrived in Soubar

We've finally arrived in the town of Soubar.  I've met with the mayor of the town, a man by the name of Sirrus Melandor.  He seems to be quite concerned about his town and the consequences it would face if the bandits were able to take control of the community.  Melandor is reluctant to send me straight out to do battle with the bandits harrassing the communities in the Chionthar Valley, and I agree with him.  Violence is not always the answer, and we all feel that if violence can be avoided, it would be best.  He has asked me to join up with the Soubar Militia, hoping that I will be able to defend the town and at the same time earn the respect of the villagers.  This I will do, and indeed, I will strive to make a difference within Soubar and defend its populous with my life.~

//CBSOUMJ1.D
@50107 = ~Enlisted

I've met with the leader of the Soubar Militia, the Major.  I've enlisted as a private in the military, and was forced to turn over all my personal belongings to the militia.  I am told, however, that they will be kept safe and that once I am released from my duties or promoted to an enlisted officer, all my belongings will be returned.  But for now, I will remain a private in the Guard.~
@50108 = ~Road Patrol

The Major has given me my first mission as a Private.  I am to report to the sergeant on the northern edge of Soubar where I will begin a tour of guard duty.  I do not know if the bandits will attempt to break through into town, but with me on the watch, I will do all that I can to prevent the death of innocent villagers in Soubar.~
@50102 = ~Rescue Scouts

Major has given me another mission.  Along with a sergeant, we'll be heading up to an outlying farm north of Soubar.  He has reported that a scouting party was ordered into that area to observe the tactical movements of the bandits.  Unfortunately, they did not return from their own mission, and Major wants me to find out what has happened to them.~

//CBSOUMJ2.D
@50104 = ~Displaced Villagers

Major has assigned me a mission in which he wants me to police the town.  As the bandits have sacked the village of Triel, west of Soubar, many of the refugees who escaped that town have migrated to Soubar.  Major is afraid that they will cause problems for Soubarians or the businesses, and asked that I spend time at the Narwhal, a posh inn/tavern on the west side of Soubar.  ~
@50109 = ~Training Militia Men

Since the incident at the Narwhal, Major has ordered me to begin the training of the Triel prisoners in hopes that they will be able to assist Soubar against the bandits.  This I will have to do, but Major has hinted that he is pleased with my performance and will promote me once again if the men are trained properly.~

//CBSOUMJ3.D
@50111 = ~Messenger Boy

I thought that becoming a Captain would give me certain privileges in the Soubar militia, but apparently not.  Major has requested that I deliver two letters to the leaders of powerful organizations in Amn.  One letter needs to go to Prelate Wessalen, leader of the Order of the Most Radiant Heart.  The other will be brought to Trademeet and delivered to Lord Logan Coprith.~
@50128 = ~Assault on Soubar!

The bandits, in retribution for the trouble I have caused Rolf Sureblade, have made an all out assault on Soubar.  Many, many villagers, guard, and others have died or gone missing in the attack.  I was able to beat off the bandits, but some happened to escape.  For this outrage, I shall hunt each bandit which has caused this trouble to the ends of Faerûn if I have to.  I have told the Major what occured, and he has told me that his Chief Lieutenant was slain while fighting the bandits.  He wants me to take the position, and I would be pleased to take over that coveted post.~
@50110 = ~Captain of a Company

The Major has assigned me a company of Soubar guards.  He has asked that I order the men to do the tasks that I used to do, guarding and patrolling the town, and to use my own judgement in doing so.  Major told me that the company was assemble outside the guard barracks and awaited me there.~

//CHARLOTJ.D
@50113 = ~Ranger Status:  Charlotte

As a ranger, Charlotte seems to know quite a bit about the region near Soubar, especially the woodlands south of Soubar and west of Baldur's Gate.  It is indeed fortunate that she was helping us, as we had to cross the mighty River Chionthar.  The point where we crossed had some swift undercurrents and was indeed COLD!  Thankfully, Charlotte told us all what to do, and we were able to get from the southeast bank to the northwest bank with little trouble.
And Charlotte is becoming more and more like a ranger again.  Hopefully, she'll regain her status soon.~
@50114 = ~Ranger Status:  Charlotte

Charlotte the fallen ranger and I have returned for a quick check on the River Chionthar's headwaters.  Things look like they are just about back to normal there.  It is good, and we think that the belladonna poison dumped in the waterway was not in large quanities, so the impact on wildlife and communities downstream will be minimal.
And Charlotte is closer still to understanding how she has fallen from grace as a ranger, and has taken a step closer to regaining the respect of others as a true Ranger.~
@50208 = ~Ranger Status:  Charlotte

Charlotte has recovered her ranger status.  It is good to see her happy once again.~

//CHARLOT0.D
@50115 = ~River Chionthar Cleaned Again!

After encountering a fallen ranger and her pet lion, we found that the mighty Chionthar running down to Baldur's Gate had been poisoned by an unwitting ogre.  The ogre, Narulf by name, had been instructed by his boss to toss a number of bottles of belladona juice into the river.  The ranger had been attempting to help a number of wild beasts who became ill and rabid from the belladona.   It was indeed lucky that we came upon the ogre before the enviornment took to much damage and may have been unable to heal itself naturally.  As we did discover the acts of Narulf in time, the river will of course clean itself as it runs its course; no pun intended.  Perhaps we'll return to see how well nature is recovering in a few days.~

//CB232CLU.D
@50200 = ~Spy In Soubar:

It seems that the Major's suspicions have proved true.  There was a spy in Soubar, and it turned out to be the boy I rescued from a farm, Charlie.  Rolf Sureblade rescued the boy and I was ambushed during the melee.~
@50202 = ~Burning Farms

While fighting bandits at a farmstead north of Soubar, I found a young boy by the name of Charlie.  He was able to escape the bandits and avoided his own death by hiding within the apple orchard.  He has told me that he saw what happened to his family when the bandits attacked the farm, but did not happen to see any Soubar scouts in the area.  I do not know if they had actually passed through the farm, nor if they themselves had been ambushed and killed by the bandits.  I will return to Soubar and report this to the Major.~

//CBWILLMA.D
@50201 = ~Sir William's Man Troubles

It seems that Selence Hillstar caught one of Athkatla's more prominent nobles in a compromising situation.  I'm not sure how he will resolve it for himself, but as far as I am concerned, I've got the key to his safe and am now going to get his money for Selence as a bribe to keep her quiet about Sir William's bedroom affairs.~

//CBLDBUCK.D
@50203 = ~Lord Hammerhand Bucko's Mansion

I was successfully able to clear out Bucko's mansion from the werebeast's infestation.  I don't think that they will return, but I may visit him again just to be sure.~

//CBISSON1.D
//CBCUTDF2.D
@50204 = ~A Lesser Bhaalspawn?

Could it be true?  I met a sorcerer today at Vyatri's in Trademeet.  He seemed a bit off his nut, but knew about me.  He said that he also had the blood of Bhaal in his veins, but whether through birth or vile experiments like what Irenicus conducts, I do not know.  It matters not either way.  Ceeb Isson, the powerful and god-like Bhaalspawn sorcerer, told me that there were some folks looking for me.  He did not know if they wanted me for good or ill, but I have a feeling I will meet them, and find out.

Hopefully, I will also have the chance to test my mettle against Ceeb, for I suppose there can only be one by the time I am finished.~

//TOMASTOJ.D
@50205 = ~Rats Rats Rats

A professional in Athkatla had taken the afternoon off from his trade and must have unwittingly acquired a Pipe of the Sewer.  He had been playing it for quite some time, and drew hundreds of rats to the city.  I was able to persuade him to stop playing the pipe, and he retired back to his trade.  The rats have lost the attraction they had for this Piper, and eventually will find other areas to infest.~

//TOMASTO1.D
@50206 = ~Tomas hunts after a half-orc named Sureblade.  He has told us that Sureblade has killed someone close to him.~

//SELENCE.D
@50207 = ~Selence Finally Gave Me Something Useful

Selence Hillstar, the smuggler/fence in Athkatla, has finally told me what I need to know.  She gave me a key which will open a locked door in an inn someplace in the city.  She said it was a popular inn, and there's only two major inns here in Athkatla.  The Five Flagons, where I met her earlier, would be a good choice, but on the other hand, the Copper Coronet is another popular tavern.  It must be one of those.  From there, she said I would find something to lead me to those men that have been looking to meet with me.  I shall have to go to one of those taverns and see if I can find any clues.~

@20067 = ~     The farms north of Soubar are normally quiet and peaceful places.  One could relax under a large oak tree or stretch under the sun besides a small pond under normal circumstances.  Unfortunately, with the troubles in the Chionthar Valley, the rolling hills on which large tracts of plowed vegetable plots, livestock pastures, or great apple orchads are worked are not a pleasant place to visit.  Bandits from Lyrar's Hold have ransacked more than one small farm, and on your day's journey north of the town, you can see the black smoke smoldering from a burned farmhouse.  
     As you enter the field of one such farm, the stench of decaying animals is noticable.  In the distance, from your hiding place over a ridge, you can see a number of bandits still roaming the farm.  There are no farmers in sight, but you pray to your gods that at least a few survived the attack.~
@20068 = ~SUREBLADE DEFEATED:

   You heave a sigh and briefly survey the damage of the tower's upper floor in Lyrar's Hold.  The room is a mess: stains of splattered blood- both Rolf's and your own- create random patterns of death on the walls, furnishings are scratched, sliced, and crushed to kindling, and metal plates of broken armor litter the floor.
   It was a monumental battle, one you will remember for all your days as an adventurer.  The battle with Rolf Sureblade, who lies dead at your feet, ranks as high in your mind as such battles as that you have had with foes like Sarevok below the city of Baldur's Gate, the first time you encountered a hostile gnoll, the battle you had against a Demon Knight deep in the dungeons of Durlag's Tower, the first time you slew a dragon, battling against fighters and mages of the Cult of the Dragon, and fighting your way out of the Underdark with drow at your heels.
   Your quests as an adventurer have taken you to many exotic places, many fantastic worlds, and allowed you to meet all types of folk- both good and bad- from Faerûn and other worlds too.  But, by the same token, your adventurers have taken their toll on you, soul and body, and you are tired.  
   Leaning heavily on the grip of your weapon, Rolf lies dead at your feet.  With his death, Soubar and the entire River Chionthar Valley can return once again to its peaceful state.  Without a leader to guide them in acts of oppression, the remaining brigands and bandits still holed up in Lyrar's are bound to disperse.  Yet you still have one more task to take care of to finish this business, clearing the Shadows Over Soubar: reporting your success to the Major of Soubar.  It will not take you long to return there, and you hope that with the completion of these missions, the Major will see fit to release you from the militia, where you can choose to continue your adventures in Amn or Tethyr, or settle down to a nice fireplace hearth at a home-like inn.~

Bolivar's past may not be particularly clear, but his personality is.  Bolivar is the archetypical dwarf: gruff, short, rude, and drunk.  Bolivar will drink anything he can find,  and if the beverage has been fermented, all the better for him.  His temper is quite short, and whether from being a dwarf, being short, being drunk, or just being, you can't quite tell.  But it may be better not to find out why he's so mean.~

Her studies, while enjoyable, were not something that Charlotte felt would be something that would make her a productive member of her culture.  She may have had the knowledge of other's great work- been able to identify the exact year a painting was originally painted and by whom, but she had not the skill or creative talent to produce her own original works.  It was then that Charlotte decided she needed something else.  Upon completing her studies as a young elf, Charlotte left the island and against her forefather's and family's wishes, traveled to to the mainland while most other Elves were leaving for Evermeet.  
	Charlotte roamed the woodlands for decades before realizing she was a ranger.  She was never formally trained in the art of being a ranger, it more or less was an epiphany to her.  She took her new found career seriously, and was quite talented.  Whether as an elf or a woman of nature, it matters not how she became talented at the ranger skills.
	Recently, Charlotte lost her faith for some reason that she is not very forthcoming about, and lost her status as a ranger.  However, she is a ranger at heart, and will regain the status of rangerhood eventually.~

When the arrowhead is imbedded into a target, whether by firing the arrow at the target or by thrusting it as a spear or dagger, the arrow causes 1 point of damage.  However, once imbedded, the arrowhead releases a curative spell that heals 2-20 (2d10) points of damage.  The arrowhead is consumed by the spell, and the shaft can easily be removed.

Sages speculate these arrows were fired by reinforcements at fighters who were wounded in battle, helping them stay in the front ranks longer.

The early days of the Banedeath did not go well for Cyric, the (then) new God of the Dead, and many of his fledgling clerics were slaughtered at the hands of powerful Banites.  Cyric soon after empowered select members of his clerical faithful with a portion of his power, so much power, in fact, that these clerics mortal forms dissolved into nothing more than mere bones and the fiery power of the Dark Sun.  These new undead, Burnbones, are similar to the Blazing Bones found in the ruins of Myth Drannor in appearance, but that is where the similarity ends.  Burnbones tend to wear the symbol of Cyric on themselves (as a holy symbol, for instance) as a sign of their devotion.~
@20434 = ~Ceeb Isson's Ecologies: On Baneliches

When Bane, the God of Strife, was first establishing his church long ago, those who worshipped him were hounded to their deaths by the forces of good unless they gathered in significant numbers.  Tired of his faithful becoming victims, every 50-60 years Bane chose the most powerful priest within the ranks of his clerics and revealed to him or her a foul rite that would transform the caster, through force of faith, strength of will, and Bane's divine hand, into a powerful, immortal form-- a lich of Bane, or Banelich.

Baneliches are gaunt, skeletal, rotting humanoid forms with black eye sockets in which burn red pin points of light.  They dress in decaying elegant clerical ceremonial robes and always wear Bane's holy symbol (the black hand of Bane) prominently.

Baneliches are immortal.  The only way a Banelich can be destroyed is by the destruction of the creature's phylactery.  The person who destroys a Banelich's phylactery and anyone within 10 feet (including the Banelich) must make a successful saving throw vs. death magic at -1 or be struck dead by the force of an incredible negative energy explosion generated by its destruction.~

This friend, Kalamnin, was a strict devotee of Amaunator, a harsh, unforgiving god now almost forgotten by sages.  Amaunator was the god of law and the god of the sun.  He required his servants to follow his edicts exactly.  Kalamnin did his best to observe Amaunator's laws in his travels.  The blade was lost when Kalamnin was killed in battle by dozens of nycadaemons.  The sorcerer who summoned the creatures, Ylmandi, kept the blade in his family until the fall of Netheril.

The new lover would simply call upon the ring and the mace would fly to his hand.

Unfortunately, Redani was done in when she trusted the wrong man to kill her old lover.  Gural of Chessenta, a well-disguised priest of Hoar, took it upon himself to gain vengeance for a man whose skull he had picked up by the side of a road.  Unluckily for Redani, priests of Hoar will go to any length to avenge the dead, even if it means animating all of her dead lovers to tear her limb from limb.

During Alerri's early days in the priesthood, he frequently provoked and attacked agents of Sune.  Unfortunately for Alerri, Lady Firehair's followers employed charm magic to cease the Banite's antics.  Once he had been charmed, Alerri was commanded to perform all sorts of embarrassing actions in the streets of Waterdeep.  After many years, Alerri decided to honor his god of hate by creating a suit of armor that would protect him from charm magic.  He communed with the spiritual minions of Bane to discover the materials and rituals necessary for the suit's creation.  Following his master's instructions, he murdered thirteen married couples and had their wedding rings woven into the hem of the mail.  He then killed thirteen elves and bathed in their blood, uttering prayers for thirteen hours.  When he was finished, his armor protected him from the magic of the Sunites and filled him with irrepressible hate.  Alerri went on a crusade against the agents of Sune, Llira, and Hanali Celanil for three years.  His killing spree ended when elven archers and priests of Corellon Larethian laid a trap for him on a road going north from Waterdeep.

The cloak was actually the cause of his doom, for it was woven and enchanted by his dark elf lover, Rauva Vrinn.  The style of the black and midnight-blue cloak was so obviously non-elven that his associates became suspicious.

Eventually, an acquaintance of Mithran, an elven drow-hunter named Gaedel, discovered Rauva's secluded hiding spot in the forests surrounding Myth Nantar.  With a small band of warriors, Gaedel stormed her hut and quickly killed her.  When Mithran discovered what had happened, he went berserk with fury.  The mad mage assaulted the hunting lodge of Gaedel and his brothers, killing them all and leveling the lodge.  Gaedel's family eventually attempted to take vengeance for the act, killing Mithran at loss of most of their house.  Mithran's cloak was recovered by his close friend, the dwarven warrior Hael Bronzelake.

Denell Harband was a human involved with the creation of the "Halfaxe Trail."  Under the orders of his commander, Halvan the Dark, he forged ahead through elven forests despite protests and repeated attacks.  When he was finally captured by the elves, he stated emphatically that he was free of guilt because he was just following his orders.  The elven council deemed that Denell be placed under a High Geas to carry his axe from the Sword Coast of Faerun to its borders in the east, and from the Great Glacier to Lurien.  It took Denell thirty years to complete his task.  When he finished, he was an accomplished warrior, weathered and beaten by years on foreign roads.  On his way back to his home, he passed by Harrowdale and saw a wooden statue of Halvan the Dark raised proudly in a small town square.  With a single-handed blow, he lodged his huge axe into Halvan's forehead.  Never breaking stride, he returned to his hut where he lived out the rest of his days as a reclusive farmer.

This instrument, held close at all times, helped Sedini fight off those who would attack him or his students.  When Sedini grew old, he passed it on to his best student, Galwen Alaman.  Galwen continued teaching for a few years before setting out into the wilderness on a life of adventure.  It is believed that he lost the lyre when he accidentally dropped it in a marsh.

@20506 = ~This seemingly threadbare robe had become "dormant" upon Lysan's command, so as not to expose herself as a priestess of Auril. When as much as a single snowflake falls upon the robe, it transforms into a scintillating cloak of white that allows the wielder to float above snow drifts and walk through even raging rivers with ease. Most merchants will not wish to purchase this item, or will do so at a very low price, as they see it as a sacred item of Auril the Frost-Maiden and likely to attract her followers... and her displeasure.

Created during the ceremonies of the Coming Storm (the onset of winter) to Auril, these robes are specially created to resist flames and allow the wearer to resist any attempt to stop or hold them. Although the priestesses of Auril are naturally resistant to cold and can move through snow and icy rivers with ease, these cloaks amplify the protection of the goddess, allowing the wearer additional cold resistance (which allows a wearer already immune to cold to absorb its power) and even goes so far as to leach the heat from fire attacks directed at the wearer. In addition, the robe may be invoked to allow the wearer to pass over or through any obstacle designed to hold them, whether Web spells, ghoul paralyzation, Hold Person spells and the like.

It still serves the same function as the original black ice mirror, but it feels much lighter now, and the reflections within the mirror seem both sharper and duller at the same time.

The power of the Mirror of Black Ice lies in its ability to confound the sight of an attacker.  Merely wearing it provides a boon to the wearer's defenses, as attackers will discover the wearer suddenly isn't where they thought he was when they first attacked.  By concentrating on the mirror, however, the wearer may alter what others see when they look at him, distorting his image to make him harder to hit, or splitting his image into several reflections of himself, further confusing attackers.  The mirror contains only a limited number amount of energy to perform these greater feats, but when the Blur and Mirror Image powers are gone, the passive defenses will remain.

The weapon has an unearthly look to it, and it is believed to be quite old.  The only individual known to have carried the weapon was a half-elven bard named Daen Winterbrush.  It is said by some that after he found the sword, quite by accident, that he was blessed with exceptional creativity and powerful sensitivity to the world around him.  He traveled for forty years and is known for some of the most unique, haunting melodies in Faerun.  It is believed that Daen eventually became too melancholy at the sights of misery and oppression that he encountered in his travels, and that the fae smiths of the Moonshae Isles welcomed him into the breast of Myrloch.

Born in Sembia and raised in a musical family, Pellon Kay never took his performances seriously.  Kay made dozens of enemies everywhere he went because of his acidic wit and appetite for confrontation.  Sages believe that Milil frowned upon Pellon's antics, but that Talos found Pellon's attitude to be quite amusing.  The avatar of Talos watched Pellon start a fight with over twenty men in a bar one night.  As a gift for such destructive entertainment, Talos touched the lute that was laying next to Pellon's unconscious body.  After that night, Pellon discovered that he could make men go berserk just by playing his lute in their direction.  He took great delight in setting mercenaries and sailors against each other for several weeks.  Eventually, Pellon Kay was laid low by a grim-featured warrior with a crossbow who didn't let Pellon get close enough to employ his magical lute.

Pelham eventually enchanted Owain's Lullabye for the bard in exchange for a small sum of money.  Owain rarely used the instrument in battle, typically employing it when he found late-migrating geese lounging on a lake.  He would blow the horn in such a way that the geese heard it as the sound of their cousins heading south for the winter.  As the geese would attempt to take flight, Owain's horn would freeze them in mid-stroke, where he would leave them to die.

Bordel won far more of the competitions than he lost, and he had a reputation for having extremely heavy footsteps.  This earned him the nickname "Stomper."  When Bordel died in a rockslide, he was buried in the wilderness.  Several years after his death, rumors began circulating that Bordel's boots were actually enchanted to make him sound loud when he approached.  This rumor spiraled out of control, eventually going so far as to say that Bordel's boots were capable of shaking down houses with their weight.

The weapon was lost in Calimshan when a holy slayer pursued a pasha's blasphemous agents to Calimport.  The scimitar remained in the hands of Baris Cabal for about a dozen years before the band was broken up by Ilban and his companions.

The cloak twists in torchlight, each strand of hair raveling and unraveling about the others so subtly that it appears as if a light breeze is rippling the cloak.

This cloak is woven from the hair of virgins sent to the Burial Isle to sleep with their dead barbarian lords.  It was the Seer's duty to comfort these women, to soothe their pain - in order to do so, she took a lock of hair from each and wove the strands into a cloak that would draw the spirits of fear from the virgins and steady their hearts.  The result was a cloak that hangs heavy with guilt and does little to shield the wearer from the cold of the North.  

When worn, the hairs weave around the wielder's frame, the long strands lacing together like threads on a loom.  The cloak will not willingly unravel itself from a wearer without being coerced by a Remove Curse spell.

@20562 = ~This axe was crafted for a powerful young barbarian warrior named Hegelfden.  He was born into the Tribe of the Elk and the shamans prophesized that he would be a powerful warrior.  Hegelfden grew up believing that he was special, important, and somehow better than those around him.  By the age of seventeen, Hegelfden was an accomplished warrior.  Huge, fast, and cunning, he was more than a match for his kinsmen.  On a journey into the Spine of the World, Hegelfden captured two dwarves that he came across in a cave.  He refused to let the two workers go until they created a magnificent axe for him.  The two dwarves reluctantly agreed, creating a stout battle axe with a keen blade and a thick handle.  When the dwarves asked to be released, Hegelfden denied their request.  He wanted to keep them as servants.  The dwarves then laid a curse upon Hegelfden.  They told him that the fruit of his abuse would be the end of him.  Hegelfden laughed at the dwarves' claim and continued on with his life.  The next day, in a battle with a rival tribe, Hegelfden went berserk with blood lust, slaying every creature he came across.  His kin, convinced that he had gone mad, cut him down where he stood.  The axe was left on the field when the warriors brought Hegelfden's body back to the camp.  When they arrived, the dwarves were nowhere to be found.

@20564 = ~Ring of the Drow~
@20565 = ~This ring is made of eight strands of different unique metals entwined to form a ring.  The drow found it troublesome when their magical items deteriorated upon leaving their underground homeland for long periods of time; to combat this, they created this ring.  The Ring of the Drow is only made in the drow homelands by clerics of Lolth.  Its purpose is to keep drow-made items the wearer possesses from deteriorating.  To do so, the ring radiates an aura of magical energy that duplicates the underground radiations deep in the drow homelands.  As a side effect of the ring's magical aura, a detect magic spell reveals the wearer to radiate magic strongly.  In addition, a detect evil shows the wearer of one of these rings as evil, and a know alingment indicates that the wearer is chaotic evil, regardless of the wearer's true alignment.  If the wearer uses a psionic power of aura alteration to change the aura, the wearer must save vs. spells or else change alignment to chaotic evil.  If the wearer saves, or if the wearer fails to save but is already chaotic-evil, the psionic power functions normally, and the ring's aura is temporarily changed.
  
  To possess one of these rings is considered an honor among the drow, because it signifies that the wearer has traveled far from the homeland, and that he or she was aided by a cleric favored of Lolth.  Drow will kill any creature other than a drow that possesses one of these rings.~

This pair of field glasses was given to you by the Major of the Soubar Guard.  They will reveal a small area on a map from far away, per the spell Farsight, without the use of magic.  The Major suggested that you use them to scout the bandits at the farms north of Soubar, so it would be wise to hold on to these until your mission there is completed.

@20598 = ~Ceeb Isson's Ecologies: On Hellblades

It was rumored many a year ago that during the great wars when the Elves united to battle the Dark Elves and to cause them to flee to the vast underground, Gulgaraith, a well-experienced fighter/mage Dark Elf, forged numerous swords of great power to help in those wars.  This is how the Hellblades came to surface on the mortal world of man.  Nobody knows how many blades were actually forged and enchanted and how many still exist after so many centuries.  All that is known is that the Hellblades are weapons of quite evil power.

Overall Effects:  Each Hellblade functions as a modified Sword of Sharpness, they are all +3 weapons and can sever a random limb on a natural roll of 20.  These weapons are so powerful and evilly enchanted that if broken they will simply reform themselves and if ever torn away from their owner they will simple slide closer to get within the presense of their owner, distance not being a factor, though it may take some time to get to its owner if the distance is very great.  However, their most known power is the ability, on a natural 20, to instantly kill a target.  Those slain by a Hellblade are dead, and cannot be raised or resurrected.  Each Hellblade also has an ego, Intelligence, and a defensive power to help its owner.  Hellblades cannot, however, talk, use Telepathy, and the like.

Hellblades can be dangerous for both the target and the wielder.  When a Hellblade chooses a new owner, the Hellblade will try with all its might to stay with the owner.  If a Hellblade is seperated from the owner, it will return.  If the Hellblade is sold away from the owner, it will return.  As the bond between the Hellblade and the owner becomes stronger, the owner will begin to change alignment.  A stronger bond between a Hellblade and owner will cause the owner to do things that the Hellblade wishes, i.e., if the owner drops a Hellblade, the Hellblade will "instruct" the owner to pick it up, regardless of the owners rational wishes.

Take care when looking at a particular Hellblade's functions, for knowing the functions may cause the Hellblade to "choose" the identifier as its new owner.

The blade is regular length for such a weapon, though slightly slimmer than what is normal for a long sword.  The hilt is a seperate piece and of regular steel.  The cross piece looks like two crescent moons each overlapping the other, similar to () overcrossing each other at the ends and the blade coming through the middle gap.  The hilt is also wrapped in a cross-hatched pattern of blue and green wire threads.

The blade was constructed some one-hundred-fifty years ago by a human ranger turned mage from the Archwood area, named Frasfer the Brown.  He and a few companions were keeping guard in the Archwood, when an influx of werewolves caused him to attempt the creation of a magical means to making their elimination easier.  One of his companions was a druid, and the mixing of druidic magic and wizard magic created a blade reknowned for a later owner.

That later owner was Nazger, a soldier of Sembia who found the sword fifty years ago.  He used it to find wererats that were murdering people in Highmoon, a city just northwest of the Archwood.  So Nazger exposed the wererats and killed most of them off.  However, while fighting in the sewers of the city he disappeared.  Nothing was ever again found of Nazger, except his sword.  It was later recognized in the market, but reported too late.  It was sold to a caravan heading to Ordulin.

As Nazgar had no immediate family the city guard did little investigation.  All that was turned up was that a street beggar found the blade in the sewers and thought to sell it for food in the market.  The begger claimed to know nothing else.

The powers of the blade may have become revealed to the caravan and thus kept, or may have remained unknown and sold as merely a silver sword.

The Sword of Nazger is an unintelligent magic blade that is normally +1 to hit/damage, but gives a +3 bonus to hit/damage versus werecreatures of all types.  It also gives the wielder a tingling sensation similar to when one's hand falls asleep when werecreatures are within 60' of the user, though it won't indicate who it is that is a werecreature, nor get more powerful if the werebeast gets closer.   The blade will also appear to have a set of glyphs along the blade if viewed under a full moon.

@20658 = ~Volumes such as this one come along but once in a life-time.  You are wise indeed to have opened this tome after, I hope, laying down good coin for it, for your eyes now look upon more lore useful to spellcasters than can now look upon more lore useful to spellcasters than can be found anywhere else in all Faerûn. Oh, there are more powerful spells, and books that bristle with more of them, but this is the place where lore about the use of such magic appears. The reader of Volo's Guide to All Things Magical can gain a brief taste of the rich variety and manyfold complexity of the Art of wielding magic, at least, as human mages outside of secretive Thay and Halruaa practice it.

Writing this book almost got me killed, or worse, transformed into a helpless shape and placed in a spell-governed situation of endless torment where death would remain forever elusive, but the raw pain would make it desirable (or so a certain Catanarla the Crimson Cloaked, a sorceress of Telflamm, promised me). Many mages, it seemed, objected to my revelations of their pet spells, past peccadilloes, secret words, and names of power.  Elminster and Khelben between them saw to it that I lived though not before amusing themselves by delivering me into the claw- er, graceful hands of the Simbul, Witch-Queen of Aglarond, who demonstrated upon
my person what the consequences of future unauthorized sorcerous journalism would be. It is not much fun to be thrust into bird form and forced to fly full-tilt into a stone wall, not to mention smelling all the hair burnt out of my head, along with other more- horrific-  experiences.

I will not even open the subject of all the curses that are riding upon me as we speak, ready to strike if I do delve further into any means of revealing the secrets of sorcery. Suffice it to say that I am going to be a very good boy where dealings with wizards are concerned for a long time to come. They have promised me that.
This book of mine, however (suitably butcher- er, revised and embellished by the vigilant Elminster), will now see a wider audience than I had ever hoped it would, and some, at least, of the juicy secrets I uncovered will be shared with readers who are not all (I hope) crotchety old archwizards or liches already.  So welcome, and read on: magnificent power and fascinating lore about it awaits thee, as old Elminster might say. 

This spot is perhaps the best place to touch on a few odd topics that do not fit anywhere else in this dissertation. They are but a few of the fascinating things I have learned about sorcery in Faerûn. Read on, and discover a whole book of them. It is my hope that my Faerûnian readers find this work both enjoyable and practical and that it goads them into at least investigating magic. Life for all in the Realms can only become richer and better if there are many folk who can wield a modest amount of magic rather than a few stunted old graybeards who wield a lot!

@20659 = ~Scepter of Savras~
@20660 = ~The Scepter of Savras is a four foot long staff of carved, smoky grey duskwood inlaid with nine star sapphires along the shaft.  A one inch diameter diamond engraved with the symbol of Savras the All-Seeing caps the base of the scepter, and a three-inch diameter diamond (reputed to have 1000 facets) that is engraved with the symbol of Azuth tops the staff.

HISTORY:
     After the fall of Netheril and before the founding of Myth Drannor, the gods of the Realms battled in the Dawn Cataclysm, foreshadowing the destruction that would occur as a result of the Fall of the Gods in the Year of Shadows.  Gods were slain in battles that shook the Realms, new dieties were created, and Tyche was sundered into Tymora and Beshaba.  During this time of turmoil, two gods elevated by Mystra at different times to aid her by overseeing the porfolio of wizards battled for supremacy.  Azuth defeated Savras the All-Seeing and imprisoned his essence within a powerful artifact he had constructed prior to the conflict.
     The Lord of Spells, as Azuth was thereafter known, intended to keep the scepter in which Savras was imprisoned as his staff of office.  Although reduced to demipower status as a result of the conflict, Savras was still powerful enough to Teleport his prison into the Realms where it passed beyond Azuth's reach.  (As the All-Seeing One and Lord of Divination Magics, Savras could just barely block even Azuth's divination abilities.)  The Scepter of Savras, as the artifact came to be known, passed through the hands of countless archmages over the centuries.  Savras was always seeking to break free of his prison, and he subliminally (as the Spirit of the Scepter) influenced many a wizard to assist him in reaching his goal.
     Before Savras could break free, however, the Scepter came into the hands of Syluné Silverhand, one of the Seven Sisters.  Savras permanently granted her the abilities of a weredragon, enabling her to take the shape of a mature adult silver dragon at will.  The All-Seeing One hoped to convince Syluné to free him from his ancient prison, believing that she had the power to do so as one of Mystra's Chosen.
     Syluné turned a deaf ear to Savras's entreaties, as she did not trust the fallen god, and instead used her formidable powers and the Scepter during numerous adventures.  Eventually she willingly surrendered the Scepter to Azuth upon his request.  (Word of the artifact's location finally reached the Lord of Mages by roundabout ways in time for him to recover it.)  Syluné had used the Scepter to uncover some secrets of the doings of the powers (gods) of the Realms that Mystra deemed it better for mortals not to know.
     Once Azuth finally reaquired the Scepter of Savras, he found himself troubled by the long imprisonment the All-Seeing One had endured at his hand.  Following the Time of Troubles, the Patron of Wizards agreed to Savras's request to be released in exchange for a pledge of fealty by Savras to the High One.
     Today Savras is a demipower who serves Azuth, albeit uneasily, and whose portfolio encompasses all divinations and divination magic.  The two deities seem to be cautiously working toward friendship and a formal division of portfolios.  Some sages speculate that the All-Seeing One is attemptingb to widen his portfolio to include the idiosyncrasies of fate since he can see the future as well as the past.  These inclinations will likely come to naught, since Tymora and Beshaba would definately find such a move not to their liking.  The Scepter of Savras abruptly vanished during the god's release from his imprisonment.  Like the Cyrinishad, the Scepter is apparently invisible to all godly purview.  Rumors of its appearence in scattered locations throughout Faerun are increasing, however, suggesting the Scepter is still in the Realms- and still contains much of the power used to create it.

@20661 = ~Zeladazar, The Ghost Sword~
@20662 = ~The Ghost Sword is a long sword whose blade is invisible, though gilimmers of light may sometimes bee seen flashing along the unseen steel when it strikes something- armor for example- that bears an enchantment.  All that is normally visible of Zeladazar is a heavy steal hilt, from quillons to pommel. The pommel nut is a burnished steel sphere as large as a small orange.  The grip is wrapped in black leather, and the visible metal is blued, smooth-worn, and massive.

HISTORY:
     In the waning, decadent days of Netheril, a peculiar (for his people) sorcerer named Twyluth Ornadyn hit upon the idea that the salvation of the Netherese lay in turning their magical skills and lives back to living in harmorny with nature and other living things.  Ornadyn foresaw the need for battle magic to safeguard the survival of the Netherese as they learned the ways of all life, and he envisaged an armory of enchanted blades whose wielders could communicate with each other over long distances through meditation and the blades' transmission of mental images and audible speech.  He set about making a pair of these blades to test relevant existing magic and to develop new spells as necessary- but was slain by a treacherous apprentics, who snatched up one of the blades in the midst of it being imbued with an enchantment and beheaded Ornadyn.  The headless archmage's body lived on through previously cast defensive magics and took up the other sword to avenge himself.  In the ensuing battle, Ornadyn was hacked apart, but one of the blades exploded, destroying the apprentice utterly.
     The surviving sword was found and passed into the possession of the Netherese archwizard Alados Sorngol, who dubbed it the Sword of Dreams because of the visions handling it brought.  These images were sourced in the blade's enchantments and the revenant spirit of Ornadyn, who sent phantoms to frighten Alados ant to wrest control of the blade from him.  Their success was such that the terrified Alados bound new spells into the blade to make it a destroyer of undead- but died anyway when Ornadyn sent a last "blood spell" through the blade, searing the vitality of Alados with Ornadyn's own unlife, so that the essences of the two mages destroyed each other.

POWERS:
     Only magic can make the invisible blade of Zeladazar visible.  Whenever it is drawn, its wielder is immune to paralysis, energy drain, as well as enjoying the benefits of a Ring of Free Action.  Its wielder is able to move and attack freely and normally, even when attacked by a Web, Hold, or Slow spell (which Zeladazar gives its wielder complete immunity to) or when underwater (though the sword does not empower an air-breathing being to breathe under water).
     The Ghost Sword does 1d12 points of damage to all living creatures (regardless of size), and 4d12 points per successful strike to all undead creatures.  The touch of the blade destroys ghosts upon contact.

@20663 = ~Dzance's Guardian~
@20664 = ~The ranger Dzance found this shield in a chest in the depths of Gauntlgrym, The Lost City; its origin is unknown but thought to be of dwarven manufacture.  Dzance's Journals tell us of the properties of this item.  When he retired from adventuring to live in the Lady's Court at Silverymoon, Dzance gave the Guardian to Belpir, a young knight of that city.  The new owner forthwith went adventuring and has not been seen since.  The fates of Belpir and the Guardian are yet a mystery.

FUNCTION:

The Guardian is a "+0 Shield":  magical in nature but conferring no armor class bonus to its bearer besides the one-place benifit provided by any shield.  However, it has a special defensive power:  when worn, it radiates an insubstantial magical energy field that envelopes its bearer, and only the bearer, like an aura.  Any Magic Missile directed at the Guardian's bearer from any direction- not just ahead- strikes this field and is reflected unerringly back at the sender with no damage to the shieldbearer.  The field also absorbs all electrical discharges of natural or magical origin, such as shocking grasp, lightning bolt, or chain lightning, without harm to the bearer.  These attacks dissipate gradually and harmlessly if the shield is taken off, but if the shieldbearer can bring the shield into physical contact with a foe, the entire stored electrical energy of the field can be transmitted to the foe (save vs. paralyzation for half damage).  When this discharge is activated by the bearer's will, there is a 30% chance that the bearer and shield (but not any companion creatures or foes, will be Plane Shifted to a random known plane of existance.

Of the dozen or so sets created, two have been known to be destroyed, and three others are being used in the North.  The other seven have disappeared, and it is not known whether they are still in existence.

FUNCTION:

Storm armor is Full Plate Armor, +2, of a peculiar non-metallic alloy.  It does not conduct electricity, and has the power to transfer heat to and from the surrounding air, so the wearer remains comfortable in a freezing gale or under the hot desert sun.  The wearer is thus largely unaffected by Fireball and Ice Storm or Cone Of Cold spells, and immune to electrical damage of any type.  The wearer can stand securely, or move in a normal speed, in the face of even the most powerful winds.

@20668 = ~Giiraegisir~
@20669 = ~A Pin or brooch is a simple adornment to any cloak, cape, or other fashionable clothing.  ~
@20670 = ~Brooch of Guardianship

All the fashion rage of early and modern Myth Drannor, these elaborate brooches are worn as amulets and neck jewelry, cameo breastpins, and cloak-fastening pins.  While each is distinct and unique in ists decoration, detail, and materials, all share a basic form: an oval-shaped ivory cameo, a large metal pin attached to the cameo's back, a recess within the pin's setting for a necklace chain, mementos, or secret items, and a basic enchantment.

When the giiraegisir is grasped and pulled down along its setting (sliding with a soft click in the setting but not pulling it out of its fastening), the base magic is activated: An invisible field of energy surrounds the wearer, providing Armor Class 0 for three rounds.  The giiraegis' magic is usable once per day, after which the pin is dormant and powerless for 24 hours.

Many giiraegisir are designed to bear special symbols, such as House seals or wizards' sigils, or include elaborate embellishments to make them major pieces of jewelry designed to display the opulence of the elf rather than boast of power.  They can appear as innate parts of an intricate stomacher on a noblewoman's gown, a belt buckle, over large earrings, or even an ornament on an armored bracer.

These giiraegisir are also adapted magically, and additional minor enchantments can be placed in them.  However, all the powers of a giiraegis are activated by whatever trigger is set within the cameo, whether it is shifted in its setting, rubbed sunwise twic, or simply tapped three times.

@20671 = ~Girdle of Lions~
@20672 = ~This belt appears to be like any other magical girdle when first encountered.  When it is put on, the wearer gains several special abilities.  Wearing a Girdle of Lions enables one to speak with felines in such a way as to summon the nearest feline (normally a lion) which can give advice or obey reasonable commands.

The wearer also gains the ability to land after a fall in such a way as to minimize physical damage.

The Girdle enables the wearer to Move Silently as per the thief ability, with a minimum 50% chance of success.  If the wearer is a thief, assassin, monk, or other character or creature who already has the ability to move silently, then the chance of success is adjusted upward by +50%, to a maximum of 99%.

Finally, the Girdle confers a sort of night vision similar to that possessed by cats.  If any light source is within view of the wearer, he can see in the dark as clearly as if he were in broad daylight.

They have served my purpose well enough, though I am not happy about the dealings they had with the Bhaalspawn.  I would rather that they had not have been exposed by the One, and has paid for this failure.  The fact that these farmers were exposed has forced me to take drastic measures against Soubar, sooner than I had desired, and I expect that by the end of the season, the entire region will finally be under my control."

@20710 = ~On Shadows Over Soubar:

As it is customary for unofficial expansions to Infinity Engine games (TDSotSC, TDD) to include a book about the expansion, I thought I should put in one as well.  So here goes:

First, I am cbisson, the creator of SoS.  I want to thank you all for playing my little (300MB isn't really little) expansion, and hope you enjoy it.  I can tell you that I had a lot of fun making it, despite the number of problems I had during the construction, if you will.  I went through two notebook hard drives and more CD-R's for backups than I can count.  Despite my forethought of backing up the files, I still managed to delete the graveyard areas and all the quest stuff relating to robbing the Adventurer's Mart for Selence.  It wasn't too difficult to re-make those files, but it did set me back two or three weeks.

Second, I realize that the main quest of the adventure isn't really spectacular by any means, I mean, how original is a bunch of bandits attacking a town?  Well, be that as it may, I think I did a pretty good job with most of the scripting individual parts to all the quests.  For example, I truly enjoy scripting the behind the scenes stuff, like Selence and her attempts at pickpocketing.  Scripting Hellblades to work almost just right was a trick too, and it's a lot of fun to see it work the way it was intended, if not a bit mechanical.  So I hope you get a chance to sit back and watch some of those things.

Next, I think I want to say something about the creation itself.  None of this would have been at all possible without the indirect efforts of so many people.  Most of those are the members of TeamBG.  Ken Baker, TL, Cat, Gorin, Gaelion and PatternStorm, gafman, Theo, Manveru, Maltanar, and Jon.  Forgive me if I left anyone out... and tell me to add it in a patch!  Without their skill at making the number of programs I've used for Shadows Over Soubar, you wouldn't be reading this now as I would never have attempted to even begin such a task.  So, with the greatest appreciation to those programmers, I say thank you and well done.  

Finally, as I am writing this text, Shadows of Soubar's completion draws ever nearer.  What I had thought would be about 150MB of an expansion with only about 40 extra areas, turned into about 300MBs and close to 100 extra areas; 3 brand new ones.  What I had thought would be a four or five month project just took up the last nine months of my life.  Hey, I could have had a baby in that amount of time.  No, wait, I can't have a baby, but I had a lot of fun trying during the last nine months, and that has nothing to do with this expansion, if ya know what I mean, (wink wink, nudge nudge).

Seriously though, I am quite pleased at the result.  Shadows Over Soubar is an accomplishment of mine, and with you all playing it, perhaps it will be another successful accomplishment.

Thank You,
All My Best,
God Bless,

CBisson

Skeletons need not be complete, but the skulls must be present, and skeletons lacking the parts of course have their actions and/or their mobility impaired.  Such animation is permanent, lasting until the magic is dispelled or the skeletons destroyed.

Twenty five percent of these staffs staves have a secondary function:  mending broken bones of both living and dead creatures.  This takes one charge, and in a round will reattach a severed limb or digit, or cure lost HP due to wounds.  Limbs or bones not belonging to the recipient may be used; thus a heap of bones can serve as "spare parts" for a guard of skeletons.  Typically, these staves are of ebony topped with an ivory skull, or constructed of a smooth polished skull and a thighbone of giant size.

@20800 = ~Installing FENCE kit...~

@20802 = ~FENCE:
  The Fence is a black marketeer, a seller of stolen or otherwise illegal goods. He is almost always found in a city setting, where there are large numbers of people to serve as customers as well as prey for the thieves who supply him.  A good Fence needs a sharp mind to appraise people as well as goods, and to stay ahead of the law. To take this kit, therefore, a thief needs a minimum Intelligence of 12.

Role: The Fence is the linchpin in the complicated web of the black market. Thieves sell their illicit acquisitions to the Fence, for some amount of money below their actual value. The Fence then resells the "hot" goods on the black market. If the city in which he operates is large and the goods are minor enough (not the crown jewels of the local royalty), they may be sold directly to local buyers. If the Fence thinks they're "too hot," though, he will probably arrange to have them smuggled and sold elsewhere.
     Power for Fences is rarely measured in terms of character level. Instead, it is a matter of the breadth of the Fence's network and the reliability of his contacts. Of course, to acquire or retain an extensive network, a Fence needs much cunning and experience which may coincidentally result in a high character level.
     Fences may be of any social background, though wealthy and noble Fences are rare.   Certainly those that do exist diligently keep their identities well-hidden, for obvious reasons. The stakes must be high to claim the attention of the socially and financially elevated.
     The black market network transfers information as well as goods. Fences are probably the best-informed figures of the underworld. 

Weapon Proficiencies: Any.

Skill Progression: Less powerful Fences (that is, those lower in the network hierarchy, with fewer contacts) may need to make use of thiefly skills. Picking pockets may provide a little income when business is slow; its use for sleight-of-hand may also have value (though it is dangerous to cheat clients). Opening locks and finding and removing traps are useful skills for inspecting merchandise. It is not unknown for Burglars, unable to open a strongbox, to simply cart off the whole thing and hope their Fence can get it open. Read languages is also sometimes useful in examining merchandise. The stealth skills (move silently, etc.) have some value on the street; Fences who have direct contact with their clients may put some time into cultivating them, but more powerful Fences often neglect them.

Special Benefits: Because of his contacts, a Fence is probably the best person for locating and hiring thieves and smugglers, especially in territory not claimed by a guild.
     Also, Fences generally command a lot of respect from the underworld in their home territory. Unless a thief has a serious vendetta, he will probably court a Fence's favor for business reasons. Fences receive a bonus of +3 on reactions with NPC thieves if their profession is recognized.

Special Hindrances: Fences are relatively prominent in the underworld. And, unlike freelance burglars and smugglers who can move from place to place, the Fences' black market network requires a stable home locale, so that they can stay in touch with their contacts. This also means that the local authorities may be aware of a Fence's identity and activities. These authorities may periodically harass a minor Fence, or demand bribes, or may shake him up for information every once in a while.

Races: Fences may be of any race. Some demihuman Fences prefer to deal only in certain goods. Dwarf and gnome Fences, for instance, are known as shrewd appraisers of stolen gems and jewelry.~

As it is, Selence has become quite a thief, and hopes to eventually run an underground network of spies, smugglers, and robbers.  Selence has a plan, which is more than most others in Faerûn can admit to, and she will do all that she can to make her dreams come true, even if her dreams are not the most ethical of dreams.~
